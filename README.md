# Go Nursery Package

Inspired by [Nathaniel J. Smith's commentary on the go statement](https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/), I implemented a simple nursery in Go a few years back based on [golang.org/x/sync/errgroup](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/sync/errgroup). I find the structure very useful. This code was used in production environments for several years within SchoolsPLP before being released here.
